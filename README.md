# Cross-species insights into placental evolution and diseases at the single-cell resolution
Overview


The placenta is a highly specialized organ in mammals, mediating the exchange of nutrients, gases, and waste between the mother and the fetus while orchestrating intricate immunological interactions to sustain successful pregnancy. Despite its essential roles, the molecular evolution underlying the placental diversity across mammalian species remains largely elusive. Here, we constructed a comprehensive mammalian placental single-cell transcriptomic atlas from approximately 300,000 cells spanning ten species that could well represent the four primary placental types (discoid, cotyledonary, diffuse, and zonary). Our cross-species analysis highlights trophoblast lineages as key drivers for placental evolution. By reconstructing differentiation trajectories, we elucidate the gene expression dynamics and regulatory networks shaping trophoblast development across diverse placental architectures. Besides, we propose that the association of human trophoblasts with conditions such as pre-eclampsia and miscarriage arises from their unique gene expression profile, which distinguishes them from trophoblasts of other species. The functional experiment further demonstrates TGIF1 as a pivotal regulator of trophoblast growth and migration, linking its dysregulation to pregnancy-related complications. Collectively, these findings provide a high-resolution framework for understanding the molecular evolution of the placenta and its role in reproductive success and diseases.
